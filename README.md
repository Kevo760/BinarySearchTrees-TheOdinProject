## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

Youâ€™ll build a balanced BST in this assignment. Do not use duplicate values because they make it more complicated and result in trees that are much harder to balance. Therefore, be sure to always remove duplicate values or check for an existing value before inserting


## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

I learned a lot more of on recursive functions and how you can loop through a function using its own function. At first it was hard to understand due to the fact how the looping worked.
Being able to see the tree visualy does help understand what is going on the tree. I also learned that the binary search tree is a method that allows the program to find things easily without
using too much computing power. 

### Continued development

I would like to continue on learning this so I am able to create the function on top of my head instead of referencing it back to tutorials and articles.

### Useful resources

- [Geeks for geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) - This allowed me to figure out how to write the code and learn how each line of code works.
